# ReactID: Efficient Generation of Unique Identifiers for React.js

## Installation

To use ReactID in your project, follow these steps:

1. Open your command-line interface (CLI).
2. Run the following command to install the ReactID package from npm:

    npm install reactjs-id

## Usage

Using ReactID in your project is straightforward. Here's how you can integrate it:

1. Import the `ReactId` function from the "reactjs-id" package into your component:

```javascript
import { ReactId } from "reactjs-id";
```

Utilize the `ReactId()` function wherever you need a unique identifier, such as when mapping through a list of items. For example:

```javascript
const mappedDesserts = desserts.map(desert => (
    <li key={ReactId()}>
    {desert.name} - {desert.calories} cal
  </li>
));
```

Please ensure that you adhere to best practices in your React.js development, and remember to optimize the usage of unique identifiers generated by ReactID for enhanced performance and reliability.
